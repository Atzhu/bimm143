Section 1. Differential Expression Analysis

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)


```
>Q1. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from countData

```{r}
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```
>Q2. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

```{r}
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
countData = countData[rowSums(countData) > 0, ]
head(countData)
```

Running DESeq2

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```



```{r}
dds
```

```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```


>Q3. Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.

```{r}
summary(res)
```

Volcono plot


```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```


>Q4. Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color and axis labels


```{r}
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj<0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```

>Q5. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```
>Q6. Finally for this section let's reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

Section 2. Pathway Analysis

```{r}
library(pathview)

```

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)

```



```{r}
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("hsa04640.pathview.png")
```



>Q7. Can you do the same procedure as above to plot the pathview figures for the top 5 down-reguled pathways?
>ANS: Just tweak the code

```{r}
## Focus on top 5 downregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$less)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("hsa04110.pathview.png")
```

Section 3. Gene Ontology (GO)

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

Section 4. Reactome Analysis

```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length(sig_genes)))
```

```{r}
write.table(sig_genes, file="significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```




>Q8: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

>ANS: The cell cycle pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”. It does match my Kegg results for the most downregulated pathway, but it does not match 100 percent with what is done with the Kegg analysis. The difference in results could be due to the fact that we are pulling results from different databases. The KEGG pathway database gives  information on how gene products interact with each other in a given pathway.This allows for analysis in coordinated differential expression over a gene set instead of just looking at individual genes. Reactome is seperate database linking biological molecules to pathways. 


>Q9: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

>ANS: According to the analysis done on Gene Ontology, the pathway with the most significant p-value would be "primary metabolic processes". However, the pathways listed on the top of the list match with better with the KEGG results. For example, the  results of trachea formation and morphogenesis matches for the upregulated genes in the KEGG results. The results for metaphase to anaphase trasition in the mitotic cycle matches with the functions of the pathways downregulated in the KEGG results. Again, I am using a different database. Gene ontology uses statistical analysis on the descriptions of function to find significance.
